	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The sorted name was easy because I already knew how to do it. Converting to an array seems a bit like a dirty trick, but okay.  I'd never done that before (that I remember). I definitely fooled around a good bit to get the CSS to place the name over my image. It helped to turn borders on for that elements so I could position it properly. There are still long names that break the formatting, but it's okay for now -- a balance of simple coding and interesting results.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I too struggled in putting a button in jQuery, but in the end.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Hit this button:</p>

	<div id="output">
		<button>Press Me</button>
	</div>
