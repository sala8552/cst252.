		<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
		<p>The objective of this lab was to help create a local file structure and add an html file </p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Trying to figure out how word the tasks into javascript was difficult. I didn't quite understand how to properly
			print task 3 on the list in a readable javascript comment, so I am hoping it turned out ok.
		</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Results: Googling javascript transitions allowed me to see how
			 different people coding and worded their code phrases in a JS document.</p>
