	<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
	<p>The objective of this lab was to help create a local file structure and add an html file </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>It was easy setting up the file structer because we installed the file structure from the template in the first day of class.
	 		but for the next section of this lab making the html I had some difficulty to make them work correctly.
	</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>This is my file structure created from the template we installed and put onto my desktop</p>
