           <h2>Challenge</h2>
           <p>The challenge of this lab was to work with your partner and look at past labs and using the knowlage about debugging to fix past labs that
						we might of had trouble with to fix them..</p>
           <h2>Problems</h2>
           <p>Didnt have much probelms with this lab.</p>
           <h2>Results</h2>
           <p>take a look below at the end Results</p>
           <h2>Debugging!</h2>
					 <p>Just like Angelina stated before we both looked at our past labs and we were able to get through all our labs correctly
						 without having to go back and debug. So taking what we have learned about everything and about debugging we can inert that to the new labs.</p>
