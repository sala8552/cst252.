	 <h2> Challenges </h2>
		 <p>There weren't any really. Just had to follow the instructions.</p>
	 <h2>Results</h2>
	 	 <p>Played around with the CSS alittle bit and wanted to add a shake image, it worked and I am greatly pleased.
			 Doing JSON for the first time in awhile was also really cool! I got the shake code mostly from W3 schools and
			hope I credited them properly in my CSS code.
